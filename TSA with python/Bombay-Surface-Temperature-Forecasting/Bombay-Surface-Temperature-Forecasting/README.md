# Chennai-Surface-Temperature-Forecasting
Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of Chennai's Surface Temperatures

### This project consists of:
1. Analysis of Chennaiâ€™s surface temperature time series data to derive trends and seasonality.
2. A 3-year surface temperature forecast using Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors (SARIMAX) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.
3. A comparison of SARIMAX and LSTM forecasts for the given data.

### About the dataset:  
This dataset contains time series data of average surface temperatures of major cities worldwide from the year 1796 upto 2013. This data was taken from Berkeley Earth Data page: http://berkeleyearth.org/data/.
